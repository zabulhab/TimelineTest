Hold left shift to toggle camera control. Scroll up/down to zoom in/out, and move mouse around to rotate camera. Letting go of shift untoggles camera control.
Left click and drag objects to rotate them.
In the second scene, RIGHT clicking a sphere will open it in Scene 3.
Scene 3 also is available to open at any time but without the additional sphere.
